#summary Instructions on getting Mozilla source code and applying our patch to it.

= Introduction =

The bulk of our xulrunner code is not hosted here; it is hosted directly on the Mozilla project's CVS servers. These are basic instructions for downloading the source from Mozilla and applying our patchset.


= Details =

First, familiarize yourself with the [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Build_Documentation Mozilla Build Documentation]

Then choose a source directory and execute the following command:

{{{
% cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot co -r FIREFOX_2_0_0_4_RELEASE mozilla/client.mk mozilla/xulrunner/config/mozconfig
}}}

Also, you'll need to explicitly check out one more file if doing a universal-binary Mac build:

{{{
% cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot co -r FIREFOX_2_0_0_4_RELEASE mozilla/client.mk mozilla/build/macosx/universal/mozconfig
}}}

Future versions of AdWords Editor may use a Mozilla build label more current than FIREFOX_2_0_0_4_RELEASE. Previous build labels will be noted below.

That done, go over to the downloads page and download the patch file appropriate for your release tag.

Apply it to your mozilla sources as follows:

{{{
% cd mozilla
% patch < [path_to_downloaded_patch_file]
}}}

That's it! You're now ready to build the application in a xulrunner configuration, per the Mozilla Build Instructions.
